# RDataScience
Tools with R for Data Science.

**_NOTE:_** This is still a newborn repo and under development only on my free time!

This repo can be used as an R package. I am also doing some fun data analysis using kaggle data. The code is located at `/examples`.

Feel free to drop any suggestions, questions or even some coffee!
